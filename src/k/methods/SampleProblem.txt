Sample Problems:

1. Create a static void method that accepts an array
	of int as the argument. The method should find
	the sum of the ints in the array and output the
	message "The total is x", where x is the total
	sum.
	
2. Create another static method that accepts a String
	as an argument. The method should return an array
	of String which contains each space-separated
	word from the given String.
