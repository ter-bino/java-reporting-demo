Sample Problems:

1. Ask for negative (while and do-while) 

	Create a program that will keep on asking for
	a negative number. The program should keep on
	looping for as long as the user's input is still
	a positive number. Print "done" when exiting the
	loop.
	
	-> Implement above with while and do-whike
	
	Sample:
	Enter a negative number: 10
	Enter a negative number: 20
	Enter a negative number: 15
	Enter a negative number: -1
	done

2. Sum of even numbers(for loop)
	
	Create a program that will find the sum of all
	numbers before n. Given n is the input from the
	user.
	
	Sample input:	Process:				Sample output:
	10		->		(2 + 4 + 6 + 8)			->	20
	11 		->		(2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10)	->	30
