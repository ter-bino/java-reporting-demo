Sample Problems:

1.	Create an array of ints whose contents are as follows
	{2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9}. Traverse the array using a for loop
	and output the sum of all of it's contents.
	
2.	Create an ArrayList and add 2, 3, 5, 6, 8 and 9 using it's
	add() method. Traverse the ArrayList with a for loop and
	use it's get() method to print it's contents one at a
	time.
