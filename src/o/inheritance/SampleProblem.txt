Sample Problems:

1.		Create a class called Person with an attribute
	name and a method greet() that outputs the message
	"Hello, (name)!".

2.		Create a class called Employee with attributes
	name and salary. It should also have: method greet()
	that outputs the message "Hello, (name)!"; method
	printSalary() which just print's "(name)'s salary
	is (salary)."
	
3. 		Create a class called Student with attributes
	name and grade. It should also have: method greet()
	that outputs the message "Hello, (name)!"; method
	printGrade() which just print's "(name)'s grade is
	(grade)."
	
4. 		Notice the repetition of codes among similar
	classes? Make use of inheritance to reduce them.
