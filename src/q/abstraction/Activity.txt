Activity:

		1. Create an abstract class/interface Writer with
	unimplemented methods write() and erase().
	
		2. Create a static method that will call write()
	and erase() method from a Writer implementation.
	
		3. Create a class Pen and make it implement Writer's
	write() and erase() method.
	
		4. Create a class Pencil and make it implement
	Writer's write() and erase() method.
	
		5. You decide what they do in the write() and erase()
	method :) (Simple print statements are enough)
	
		6. In your main method, pass an instance of Pen and
	Pencil to the static method you created in step 2.
	
	Sample main:
	someStaticMethod(new Pen());
		-> (output of write that you made)
		-> (output of erase that you made)
	someStaticMethod(new Pencil());
		-> (output of write that you made)
		-> (output of erase that you made)
