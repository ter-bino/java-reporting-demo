Activities:

1.		Create a class called Money. The class should
	have two attributes, currency (String) and amount
	(double/float). Objects of type Money should have
	method printMoney() which should output something
	like "(currency) (amount)":
		PHP 150.00
		USD 250.25
		PHP 1325.20
		
2.		Create a class called Television. This class
	should have an attribute "currentChannel" with a
	default value of 1.
	
		There must be methods:
			- channelDown() - decrements the current
				channel and output it.
			- channelUp() - increments the current
				channel and output it.
				
		Channels should only range from 1-10.
		
	Sample:
		Television television = new Television();
		television.channelUp()
		output:	Switched to channel 2!
		television.channelDown()
		output:	Switched to channel 1!
		television.channelDown()
		output:	..nothing happens..
			(because 1 is already minimum channel)
