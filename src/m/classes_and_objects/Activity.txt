Activities:

1.		Create a class Dog with an attribute name.
	Objects of type dog should have a method eat()
	which would output "(name) eats some food!".
	
	Example:
	Dog dog = new Dog();
	dog.name = "Oreo";
	dog.eat();
	-> outputs: Oreo eats some food!
	
2.		Create another class Cat which should have
	attributes name and lives(default value is 9).
	Objects of type cat should have a method respawn()
	which should be printing "(name) has (lives)
	lives remaining!". Print a different message
	if the cat can no longer respawn.
	
	Example:
	Cat cat = new Cat("Kitty");
	cat.respawn();
	-> outputs: Kitty has 8 lives remaining!
	cat.respawn();
	-> outputs: Kitty has 7 lives remaining!
	cat.respawn();
	-> outputs: Kitty has 6 lives remaining!
	cat.respawn();
	-> outputs: Kitty has 5 lives remaining!
	cat.respawn();
	-> outputs: Kitty has 4 lives remaining!
	cat.respawn();
	-> outputs: Kitty has 3 lives remaining!
	cat.respawn();
	-> outputs: Kitty has 2 lives remaining!
	cat.respawn();
	-> outputs: Kitty has 1 lives remaining!
	cat.respawn();
	-> outputs: Kitty has 0 lives remaining!
	cat.respawn();
	-> outputs: Kitty is out of lives, can't respawn!
