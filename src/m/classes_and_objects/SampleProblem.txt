Sample Problems:

1.		Create a class Dog with an attribute name.
	Objects of type dog should have a method eat()
	which would output "(name) eats some food!".
	
2.		Create another class Cat which should have
	attributes name and lives. Objects of type cat
	should have a method respawn() which should be
	printing "(name) has (lives) lives remaining!".
