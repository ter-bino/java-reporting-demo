Sample Problems:

1.		Create a Person class with attributes name and age.
	It must have a method greet() which should output the
	message "Hello, (name)! You are (age) years old!".
	
		Make use of encapsulation to protect the attribute
	age from invalid values such as 0 or negative. Name
	should also be protected from being modified into a
	blank or empty String.
	
2.		Create a Player class with attributes username and
	lives. Apply encapsulation, and set a rule such that a
	Player object's username can not contain spaces. The
	lives attribute must not have a set method, but rather
	be modified with hitPlayer() and healPlayer().
