Activities:

1.		Create an Employee class with attributes name and
	salary. It must have a method pay() which would output
	the message "(name) got paid (salary)."
	
		Make use of encapsulation to set a rule that the
	minimum salary should be 10000.00. Name should also
	be protected from being modified into a blank or empty
	String.
	
	Sample:
		
		Employee employee = new Employee("Bob", 15000.00);
		employee.pay();
			-> outputs: Bob got paid 15000.00.
		employee.setName("");
			-> throws : IllegalArgumentException()
		employee.setSalary(3000);
			-> throws : IllegalArgumentException()
			
		(use setName and setSalary on different runs)
	
	
2.		Create a BankAccount class which has attributes
	accountId and accountBalance. Apply encapsulation so
	that accountId is an 6 digit number. Instead of set
	methods, use something more logical for modifying the
	accountBalance. Also add a printDetails() method that
	should output "(accountId)'s Balance: (accountBalance)".
	
	Hint: 99999 < accountId < 1000000
	
	Sample:
	
		BankAccount account = new BankAccount(222222, 10000.00);
		account.printDetails();
			-> outputs: 222222's Balance: 10000.00
		account.?(2000.00); //decreaser method
		account.printDetails();
			-> outputs: 222222's Balance: 8000.00
		account.?(5000.00); //increaser method
		account.printDetails();
			-> outputs: 222222's Balance: 13000.00
		account.setAccountId(1);
			-> throws : IllegalArgumentException()
	

NOTE: Throw IllegalArgumentException() for invalid values.
