Activities:

1.		Create an Employee class with attributes name and
	salary. It must have a method pay() which would output
	the message "(name) got paid (salary)."
	
		Make use of encapsulation to set a rule that the
	minimum salary should be 10000.00. Name should also
	be protected from being modified into a blank or empty
	String.
	
2.		Create a BankAccount class which has attributes
	accountId and accountBalance. Apply encapsulation so
	that accountId is an 6 digit number. Instead of set
	methods, use something more logical for modifying the
	accountBalance.
	
	Hint: 99999 < accountBalance < 1000000
	

NOTE: Throw IllegalArgumentException() for invalid values.
