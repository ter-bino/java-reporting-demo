Activities:

1. 		Create a class called Shape. Add a method called
	printFormula(). The output will be "Different shapes
	have different formulas for area and perimeter". Then
	create classes Circle and Square which will implement
	polymorphism by overriding printFormula() to actually
	print the formula for area and perimeter.
	
	Sample:
	Shape shape = new Shape();
	shape.printFormula();
		-> outputs: Different shapes have different formulas
						for area and perimeter.
	Shape circle = new Circle();
	shape.printFormula();
		-> outputs: Area: pi * r ^ 2 ; Perimeter 2 * pi * r
	Shape square = new Square();
	shape.printFormula();
		-> outputs: Area: s * s ; Perimeter: s * 4
		
2. 		Create a class called Animal with method move() which
	will output "The animal moves". Create classes Dog, Fish,
	and Bird that will use polymorphism by overriding move(),
	and print how they actually move.
	
	Sample:
	Animal animal = new Animal();
	animal.move();
		-> outputs: The animal moves.
	Animal dog = new Dog();
	dog.move();
		-> outputs: The dog walks.
	Animal fish = new Fish();
	fish.move();
		-> outputs: The fish swims.
	Animal bird = new Bird();
	bird.move();
		-> outputs: The bird flies.
