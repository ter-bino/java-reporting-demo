Sample Problems:

1.		Copy the created classes from inheritance example.
	Instead of using the superclass Person's greet() method,
	override the method to include what they are.
		
		Employee class:
			"Hello, (name)! You're an employee!"
			
		Student class:
			"Hello, (name)! You're a student!"

2.		Create a class Polygon. It should have static methods
	findPerimeter(). Make use of overloading so that we can
	find the perimeter of a Polygon with three, four or five
	sides with the same method called findPerimeter().
