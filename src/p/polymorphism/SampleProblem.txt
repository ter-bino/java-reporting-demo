Sample Problems:

1.		Copy the created classes from inheritance example.
	Instead of using the superclass Person's greet() method,
	override the method to include what they are.
		
		Employee class:
			"Hello, (name)! You're an employee!"
			
		Student class:
			"Hello, (name)! You're a student!"

2.		Create classes Polygon, Triangle, Quadrilateral and
	Pentagon. Polygon must have method printSides() which
	should output "Polygons has 3 or more sides!".
	
		Make use of polymorphism so other classes should
	print their exact number of sides.
