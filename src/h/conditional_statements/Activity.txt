1. Allowed or Not

	Some rides in Star City has a minimum height for some
	of their rides. Let's say that it's 140cm.
	
	Given the height as an input, output should be either
	"Allowed" or "Not allowed"
	
	Samples:
	139 -> "Not allowed"
	140 -> "Allowed"
	160 -> "Allowed"

2. Chinese Zodiac

	Create a program that will find the chinese zodiac given
	the birth year as an input. Use the control statement that
	you find appropriate.
	
	Valid outputs are:
	"Monkey", "Rooster", "Dog", "Pig", "Rat", "Ox", "Tiger"
	"Rabbit", "Dragon", "Snake", "Horse", "Goat",
	
	Note: You will have to use modulo operator (birthyear % 12)
			then use control statement on the outcome
			
			0 = Monkey
			1 = Rooster
			2 = Dog
			3 = Pig
			4 = Rat
			5 = Ox
			6 = Tiger
			7 = Rabbit
			8 = Dragon
			9 = Snake
			10 = Horse
			11 = Goat
			
	Hint: (birthyear % 12) will return 0 to 11. The appropriate output
			is listed above.
